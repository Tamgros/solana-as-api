# User stories

- [ ] I want to approve users and be able to track/authenticate their uses across requests and not have to worry about account management 
- [ ] I want to be able to restrict access to my api because I have capacity limits. It would also be nice to appropriately price my offering
- [ ] I want my users to be able to pay me and then I can automatically grant them access to my api, no account setup needed
- [ ] want to be able to approve Paying for a specific user tx on their behalf
- [ ] I want the output of an api request to result in a payment to a user
- [ ] I want a payment on chain to Trigger some off chain functionality and then have that potentially result in some other action like an on chain payment 
- [ ] Pay or escrow for a defined service, the service can prove the work was done on chain and payment fulfilled 
- [ ] As an api user, I want their to be easy price discovery on similar APIs (an api aggregator of sorts)
